# pizza-sales-analysis-Using-MY-SQL 
In this project, I utilized my SQL skills to write queries that analyzed pizza sales data, providing valuable business insights 


🎯 **Why This Project Matters**


Too often, data is collected but not fully leveraged. In this project, I took a pizza store’s order data and used it to answer key business questions like:



🍕 Which pizzas drive the most revenue?
⏰ What are the peak ordering hours?
📈 How does order volume change by day or size?
💰 Which categories underperform despite high sales?

This wasn’t just querying tables. It was about:

Asking the right business questions

Writing efficient SQL to extract patterns



Thinking like a decision-maker, not just an analyst

🔧 **Tools Used:** SQL | Relational Joins | CTEs | Aggregations | Time-Based Analysis
📊 Outcome: A dashboard-ready analysis any pizzeria could act on
